# UCMerced Land Use Classifier

This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify land use images from the [UCMerced Land Use Dataset](http://weegee.vision.ucmerced.edu/datasets/landuse.html). The notebook follows a structured set of instructions, with each section introduced by markdown cells that describe its objective.

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset used contains 21 land use classes (e.g., agricultural, forest, residential, etc.), with 100 images per class, all of size 256×256 pixels.

## 📌 Objectives
- Preprocess and visualize the dataset
- Build a CNN model using TensorFlow/Keras
- Train and evaluate the model on the classification task
- Explore performance metrics such as accuracy and loss curves
- Optionally apply data augmentation or transfer learning

## 🛠 Dependencies
Make sure you have the following libraries installed:
- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow or Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- PIL (Pillow)

Install with:
```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib scikit-learn pillow
```

## 🚀 Usage
Run the notebook step by step. Each section is clearly marked and should be executed in order. You may need to adjust paths based on your local setup.

## 📊 Results
The notebook trains a CNN and outputs metrics such as classification accuracy, loss curves, and a confusion matrix for performance evaluation.
